# Summary
 
Here you will find documentation on various projects that I've been working on, mostly detailing the technology behind it. Below you will find brief descriptions of each of the projects that I will be going over.

### Jekyll Website 

For my [personal website](https://andykumeda.com), I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), along with the [Jekyll Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) from [hfactor](https://github.com/hfactor) that I modified. The site is running on my home server, and is also hosted as a [Github Page](https://andykumeda.github.io). The site is also hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://gh-fq64n.ondigitalocean.app/) as well.

### Nuxt Website 

For my [Web3 website](https://andyk.xyz), I chose to use the Nuxt web framework, using the [Alpine](https://alpine.nuxt.space) that I modified.

### Notion Page

For my running info, I created a public [Notion page](https://andyk.run), and used [Cloudflare](https://flat-tooth-1fb7.andyk.workers.dev/) to utilize my own personal domain name, and customize the permalink.

### Resume/CV Page

For my resume/CV, I started with the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) standard, then created an HTML and LaTex versions using [Resumake](https://resumake.io). I then take the LaTex, and generate a PDF on [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).
