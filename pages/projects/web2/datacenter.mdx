# Cloud | Datacenters


### Summary

Designed and implemented several thousand square feet of Tier 4-classified data center space, consisting of hundreds of racks containing over 10,000+ servers, as well as network and storage equipment. Additionally, responsible for integrating multiple heterogeneous server environments during mergers and acquisitions of various business entities by analyzing and auditing existing technologies, then consolidating them into newly combined platforms.

In addition to designing and operating "traditional" data centers, utilizing clusters of dedicated servers and storage appliances with a typical hierarchical edge/access/distribution/core network model, also developed "hybrid" data center networks. These networks comprise a portion of the computer resources that reside both within its own physical hardware platforms and in a virtual cloud environment (both private and/or public).

Built infrastructures within Digital Realty (FKA DuPont Fabros Technology), AT&T, Savvis|Level3 (acquired by CenturyLink, now Lumen), along with AWS, Azure, and DigitalOcean cloud providers.
